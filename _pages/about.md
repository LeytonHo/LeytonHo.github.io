I'm a senior at Brown studying applied math and CS. Currently, I'm abroad at Oxford exploring philosophy and learning about AI safety.

I've previously built software at Watershed, Vanta, and Uber. I'm a [Neo Scholar](https://neo.com/), a [Kleiner Perkins Engineering Fellow](https://fellows.kleinerperkins.com/), and a former Venture Partner at [Contrary](https://www.contrary.com/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, speed chess, and playing soccer. I'd love to chat!
